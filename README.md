# ðŸ’¸ Starling Bank - Round-Up Savings App

This is my submission for the Starling Bank Frontend Engineer Technical Challenge.

The app connects to the **Starling Sandbox API**, fetches recent transaction data, calculates round-up savings from outgoing transactions, and transfers the total to a dedicated savings goal ("Round-up Saver").
